Dungeon Adventure üè∞

Dungeon Adventure is a text-based, console RPG where players navigate a perilous dungeon filled with monsters, treasure, traps, and magical items. As you journey through the depths, you'll encounter various rooms that test your strength, strategy, and luck. Gain experience, level up, and prepare yourself for the ultimate boss battle that awaits every ten levels.

This project is a simple yet fun demonstration of Java programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, user input, randomization, and functions. It‚Äôs also designed to practice using Git and Maven, making it a great foundation for more complex games and projects.
